            Schematron Strict Selection Validation Rules
            --------------------------------------------
            This is the set of Schematron rules that have been created to enforce the use of the "Unordered" stereotype.
            These rules ensure that the number of entries in an unordered complexType of an element obey the multiplicity constraints.
            This is required so that any-order/any-multiplicity complexTypes can be constructed and validated.
