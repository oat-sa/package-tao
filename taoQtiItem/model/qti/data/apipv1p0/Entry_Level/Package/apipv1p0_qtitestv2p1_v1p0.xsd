                The anyN operator takes one or more sub-expressions each with a base-type of boolean and single cardinality. The result is a single boolean which is true if at least min of the sub-expressions are true and at most max of the sub-expressions are true. If more than n - min sub-expressions are false (where n is the total number of sub-expressions) or more than max sub-expressions are true then the result is false. If one or more sub-expressions are NULL then it is possible that neither of these conditions is satisfied, in which case the operator results in NULL. For example, if min is 3 and max is 4 and the sub-expressions have values {true,true,false,NULL} then the operator results in NULL whereas {true,false,false,NULL} results in false and {true,true,true,NULL} results in true. The result NULL indicates that the correct value for the operator cannot be determined.

                The index operator takes a sub-expression with an ordered container value and any base-type. The result is the nth value of the container. The result has the same base-type as the sub-expression but single cardinality. The first value of a container has index 1, the second 2 and so on. n must be a positive integer. If n exceeds the number of values in the container (or the sub-expression is NULL) then the result of the index operator is NULL. If n is an identifier, it is the value of n at runtime that is used.

                The InterpolationTable complexType is the container for interpolation information. An interpolationTable transforms a source float (or integer) by finding the first interpolationTableEntry with a sourceValue that is less than or equal to (subject to includeBoundary) the source value. For example, an interpolation table can be used to map a raw numeric score onto an identifier representing a grade. It may also be used to implement numeric transformations such as those from a simple raw score to a value on a calibrated scale.

                A special class used to create a mapping from a source set of any baseType (except file and duration) to a single float. Note that mappings from values of base type float should be avoided due to the difficulty of matching floating point values, see the match operator for more details. When mapping containers the result is the sum of the mapped values from the target set. See mapResponse for details.

                The mathOperator operator takes 1 or more sub-expressions which all have single cardinality and have numerical base-types. The trigonometric functions, sin, cos and tan, take one argument in radians, which evaluates to a single float. Other functions take one numerical argument. Further functions might take more than one numerical argument, e.g. atan2 (two argument arc tan). The result is a single float, except for the functions signum, floor and ceil, which return a single integer. If any of the sub-expressions is NULL, the result is NULL. If any of the sub-expressions falls outside the natural domain of the function called by mathOperator, e.g. log(0) or asin(2), then the result is NULL.

                The OutcomeProcessing complexType is the container for the outcome processing instructions. Outcome processing takes place each time the candidate submits the responses for an item (when in individual submission mode) or a group of items (when in simultaneous submission mode). It happens after any (item level) response processing triggered by the submission. The values of the test's outcome variables are always reset to their defaults prior to carrying out the instructions described by the outcomeRules. Because outcome processing happend each time the candidate submits responses the resulting values of the test-level outcomes may be used to activate test-level feedback during the test or to control the behaviour of subsequent parts through the use of preConditions and branchRules.

                The roundTo operator takes one sub-expression which must have single cardinality and a numerical base-type. The result is a single float with the value nearest to that of the expression's value such that when converted to a decimal string it represents the expression rounded by the specified rounding method to the specified precision. If the sub-expression is NULL, then the result is NULL. If the sub-expression is INF, then the result is INF. If the sub-expression is -INF, then the result is -INF. If the argument is NaN, then the result is NULL. When rounding to n significant figures, the deciding digit is the (n+1)th digit counting from the first non-zero digit from the left in the number. If the deciding digit is 5 or greater, the nth digit is increased by 1 and all digits to its right are discarded; if the deciding digit is less than 5, all digits to the right of the nth digit are discarded. When rounding to n decimal places, the deciding digit is the (n+1)th digit counting to the right from the decimal point. If the deciding digit is 5 or greater, the nth digit is increased by 1 and all digits to its right are discarded; if the deciding digit is less than 5, all digits to the right of the nth digit are discarded.

                The substring operator takes two sub-expressions which must both have an effective base-type of string and single cardinality. The result is a single boolean with a value of true if the first expression is a substring of the second expression and false if it isn't. If either sub-expression is NULL then the result of the operator is NULL.
