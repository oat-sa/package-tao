                The inside operator takes a single sub-expression which must have a baseType of point. The result is a single boolean with a value of true if the given point is inside the area defined by shape and coords. If the sub-expression is a container the result is true if any of the points are inside the area. If either sub-expression is NULL then the operator results in NULL.

                The mathOperator operator takes 1 or more sub-expressions which all have single cardinality and have numerical base-types. The trigonometric functions, sin, cos and tan, take one argument in radians, which evaluates to a single float. Other functions take one numerical argument. Further functions might take more than one numerical argument, e.g. atan2 (two argument arc tan). The result is a single float, except for the functions signum, floor and ceil, which return a single integer. If any of the sub-expressions is NULL, the result is NULL. If any of the sub-expressions falls outside the natural domain of the function called by mathOperator, e.g. log(0) or asin(2), then the result is NULL.

                The ResponseProcessing complexType is the container for response processing instructions. Response processing involves the application of a set of responseRules, including the testing of responseConditions and the evaluation of expressions involving the item variables. For delivery engines that are only designed to support very simple use cases the implementation of a system for carrying out this evaluation, conditional testing and processing may pose a barrier to the adoption of the specification.

                The roundTo operator takes one sub-expression which must have single cardinality and a numerical base-type. The result is a single float with the value nearest to that of the expression's value such that when converted to a decimal string it represents the expression rounded by the specified rounding method to the specified precision. If the sub-expression is NULL, then the result is NULL. If the sub-expression is INF, then the result is INF. If the sub-expression is -INF, then the result is -INF. If the argument is NaN, then the result is NULL. When rounding to n significant figures, the deciding digit is the (n+1)th digit counting from the first non-zero digit from the left in the number. If the deciding digit is 5 or greater, the nth digit is increased by 1 and all digits to its right are discarded; if the deciding digit is less than 5, all digits to the right of the nth digit are discarded. When rounding to n decimal places, the deciding digit is the (n+1)th digit counting to the right from the decimal point. If the deciding digit is 5 or greater, the nth digit is increased by 1 and all digits to its right are discarded; if the deciding digit is less than 5, all digits to the right of the nth digit are discarded.
