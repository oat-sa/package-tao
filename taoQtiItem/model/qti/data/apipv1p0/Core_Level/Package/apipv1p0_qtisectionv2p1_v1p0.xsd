                A Test consists of one or more Sections. An 'assessmentSection' is the binding form of a Section. More significantly, a Section is an aggregation of assessmentItems i.e. a set of Items that are used to achieve some co-ordnated assessment activity. An assessmentSection contains the rules that should be used to select and order the set of associated Sections and/or Items. Furthermore, the associated rubricBlock is used to present content that is relevant to all of the contained Sections and/or Items.

In other words, if an element is determined to be hidden then all of its content is hidden including conditionally visible elements for which the conditions are satisfied and that therefore would otherwise be visible.

The controlled time for a single item is simply the duration of the item session as defined by the builtin response variable duration. For assessmentSections, testParts and whole assessmentTests the time limits relate to the durations of all the item sessions plus any other time spent navigating that part of the test. In other words, the time includes time spent in states where no item is being interacted with, such as dedicated navigation screens. This complexType is intentionally empty.
