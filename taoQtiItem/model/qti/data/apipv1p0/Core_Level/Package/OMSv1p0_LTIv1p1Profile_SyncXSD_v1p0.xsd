            XSD Data File Information
            -------------------------
            Author:         Colin Smythe
            Date:           31st January, 2011
            Version:        1.0
            Status:         Final Release
            Description:    This is the LTIv1.1 Outcomes Profile for the LISv2.0 specification. This 
                            profile supports only the Result Manager interface with the delete*, read* 
                            and replace* operations. The data model is also profiled to remove the 
                            redundant data objects e.g. ResultValueRecord, etc. This is the XSD for the POX-based service binding.

            History:        Version 1.0: This is the first formal release of the LTIv1.1 Outcomes Profile.

            PROFILE:        This is the "LTIv1p1 Outcomes" Profile. THIS IS A PROFILE OF THE BASE SPECIFICATION.
